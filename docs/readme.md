# Laravel Recharts

With this package you can use the Recharts charting library from your Laravel application.
No JavaScript knowledge required.
The main principle is to keep the configuration simple so that you can concentrate on other things.

The library offers composed charts, that means you can mix your charting elements (for example line and bar charts).

The project is in a very early stage. At the moment line and bar charts are supported with few configuration options (you can define the basic color of each element).

Later on I plan to add more customization options like customizing the cartesian grid of the chart for example.
